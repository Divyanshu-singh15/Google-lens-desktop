# Google-lens-desktop

A quick video on how it works ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0eEuhCZuHA

An app that uses python webview library to fetch and show data of google lens search,
you can just press win + shift + s and take a screenshot of whatever
you want to search and it will show you the result, you can copy the text from the fetched result or translate etc
that the google lens does on phone. 

The app runs in background and it can be quit from the systemtray by right clicking and then quit.
